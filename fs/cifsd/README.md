## What is CIFSD?

CIFSD is an opensource In-kernel CIFS/SMB3 server created by Namjae Jeon for Linux Kernel. It's an implementation of SMB/CIFS protocol in kernel space for sharing files and IPC services over network. Initially the target is to provide improved file I/O performances, but the bigger goal is to have some new features which are much easier to develop and maintain inside the kernel and expose the layers fully. Directions can be attributed to sections where SAMBA is moving to few modules inside the kernel to have features like RDMA(Remote direct memory access) to work with actual performance gain.


## Under PFIF

This code was developed in participation with the Protocol Freedom Information Foundation.

or open issues/send PRs to [CIFSD](https://github.com/cifsd-team/cifsd).


## Installing as a stand-alone module

Install prerequisite package for Fedora, RHEL:
```
	yum install kernel-devel-$(uname -r)
```

Build step:
```
	make
	sudo make install
```

To load the driver manually, run this as root:
```
	modprobe cifsd
```


## Installing as a part of the kernel

1. Let's take [linux] as the path to your kernel source dir.
```
	cd [linux]
	cp -ar cifsd [linux]/fs/
```

2. edit [linux]/fs/Kconfig
```
	source "fs/cifs/Kconfig"
	+source "fs/cifsd/Kconfig"
	source "fs/coda/Kconfig"
```

3. edit [linux]/fs/Makefile
```
	obj-$(CONFIG_CIFS)              += cifs/
	+obj-$(CONFIG_CIFS_SERVER)       += cifsd/
	obj-$(CONFIG_HPFS_FS)           += hpfs/
```
4. make menuconfig and set cifsd
```
